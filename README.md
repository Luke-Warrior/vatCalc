# vatCalc
An evolving VAT Calculator which improves with my knowledge base

v.1.0
Takes a set amount and works out what the VAT of this amount will be along with the total amount including VAT. Logs the results to the console.

v.1.1
Refactored the code into a function so the calculator is repetable in the future when I figure out how to use the script with a HTML page.
